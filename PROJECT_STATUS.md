# Rails Migration Assistant - Project Status

## Project Overview

The Rails Migration Assistant is a professional-grade tool designed to help developers migrate Ruby on Rails applications between major versions. The system uses a local Large Language Model (DeepSeek Coder 6.7B) with hybrid analysis capabilities to provide comprehensive migration assistance.

## Current Status

### Technical Architecture
- **Local LLM Only**: Complete removal of external API dependencies (Gemini API removed)
- **Hybrid Analysis System**: Two-tiered detection with pattern matching and RAG-based analysis
- **Enhanced Security Detection**: Combined mass assignment and deprecation vulnerability handling
- **Professional Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation without casual language

### Core Components
1. **Hybrid Analyzer** (`src/analyzer/hybrid_analyzer.py`): Main analysis engine with combined vulnerability detection
2. **Local LLM** (`src/model/local_llm.py`): Optimized 4-bit quantized model for offline operation
3. **GUI Interface** (`rails_upgrade_gui.py`): User-friendly Tkinter interface with response cleaning
4. **Project Scanner** (`src/analyzer/project_scanner.py`): Enhanced security vulnerability detection
5. **Code Parser** (`src/analyzer/code_parser.py`): Advanced code analysis with Strong Parameters generation

### Key Features
- Mass assignment vulnerability detection with deprecation handling
- Rails version upgrade assistance (4.2 to 7.0+)
- Security vulnerability identification and remediation
- Professional documentation generation
- Clean project structure for deployment

### Removed Components
- All test files and test directories
- Development tools and debug scripts
- Demo applications and examples
- Gemini API integration
- Casual documentation with emojis
- Temporary development artifacts

### Technical Specifications
- **Python Version**: 3.9+
- **LLM Model**: DeepSeek Coder 6.7B (4-bit quantized)
